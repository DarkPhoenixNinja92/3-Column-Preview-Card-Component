## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I primarily learned how to be more consistent with using flexbox, making better use of those properties and how to make use of border radius (I'd used it before but only on occasion and this was the first time I had used it semi-extensively).

### Continued development

In the future, I want to work on being more able to recognize when to use flexbox over positioning with directional modifications (left, right, up, down) as I currently just kind of ballpark it with this sort of thing.
